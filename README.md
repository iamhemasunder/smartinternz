The Health AI Assistant is a dedicated, standalone graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using Python. Its core functionality revolves around providing users with general health information and answering common health-related questions. This is achieved by integrating with and leveraging the advanced capabilities of IBM Watsonx AI's Granite large language models (LLMs). 
The primary purpose of this project is to create an accessible and user-friendly AI assistant focused on health inquiries. It aims to demonstrate the practical application of IBM Watsonx AI's generative models in a desktop environment, providing immediate, informative responses to health-related questions while securely handling API credentials through environment variables. The project serves as a clear example of how to build an intelligent, responsive GUI application that interacts with powerful cloud-based AI services without exposing sensitive information.
